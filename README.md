# badge-assets

Storage for things like badge images for which we need a public url to use in the badge.

Once you've added your image to the repo, you more than likely want to use the Github Pages link to the image, rather than the github raw url.

So, for the DCC_Delft_Summit_Attendee.png image, for example, you'd point at the image with this url:

```https://digitalcredentials.github.io/badge-assets/DCC_Delft_Summit_Attendee.png```

The Github Pages link to the image sets the content-type as image, whereas the raw github url doesn't, and some consumers of the image might need the correct content type.
